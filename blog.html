                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have
                    global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program,
                    any
                    function or conditional state can access that variable.
                    It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code block will
                    have
                    access to those variables.
                    <br>
                    For example:
                    var name = "linuxHint";

                    function printName(){
                    // the variable can be accessed inside here
                    console.log("This tutorial is by "+name);
                    }

                    printName();
                    
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl m-6 p-6">
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly
                    brackets {}.

            <h1 class="text-center text-4xl font-semibold">How event loop works?</h1>
            <p class="text-xl m-6 p-6">
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a
                single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s
                take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                <br>
                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
                <br>
                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue
                data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
                <br>
                Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                browser.
                Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

                An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it
                is
                sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for
                processing.

                Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate
                threads.

                The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If
                it
                is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is
                processed.

            <h1 class=" text-center text-4xl font-semibold">Different ways to get undefined.</h1>
            <p class="text-xl m-6 p-6">
                undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
                value
                of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is
                not
                the case, avoid overriding it.)

                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned.
